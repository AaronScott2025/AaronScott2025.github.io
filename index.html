        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Aaron Scott, and I'm 22 years old and have been interested in computer-related endeavors for as long as I can remember! I'm extremely ambitious to be my best self, both socially and in the workplace. I grew up on Long Island my whole life, and have always loved it here. I am currently persuing my BS in Computer Science at Farmingdale State College, and have loved my time learning at this facility. I am hoping that my education, both in acadamia and in my extra efforts, will let me push the current boundaries of Artificial Intelligence. I am enthusiastic about contributing my skills to a dynamic team focused on developing innovative software solutions. My passion for cutting-edge technologies drives me to excel in collaborative environments, and I look forward to making a meaningful impact.</p>

        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p> As stated before, I am persuing my BS in Computer Science at Farmingdale State College, and I am set to graduate in 2025, but this is far from my only area of study in the field. As i grew closer to obtaining my degree, I had found myself wanting to seek out more of the field on my own. This lead me to learn Python, which is the first Language I learned outside that of an official Educational Facility, where i made code to fix the little problems I faced on my computer. After these projects, I wanted to research areas of expertise to dedicate my free time to learning. This lead me to study Full Stack Development for a little bit, but ultimately I became drawn into the world of Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I took an Artificial Intelligence course at my College after deciding to explore this field, where I collaberated on a research paper with my professor about the potential applications of GPT models and Computer vision into the Homeschool System. This leads us to today, where I have been taking a course by IBM to obtain my "IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate", which will teach me not only about AI and ML techniques, but also how to efficiently function in a professional environment. And lastly, I have been doing smaller certificates on LinkedIn Learning, to educate myself in the more mathematical side of data and AI, such as Statistics, and Linear Algebra.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience and Soft Skills</h2>
        <p> I was very eager to begin working as soon as I could. When I was 14 years old, I had applied to and recieved my job at Mc'donalds. I had stayed there for 3 years, met alot of wonderful people, and loved my time there. I recieved a promotion at 16 years old, and recieved employee of the month the first month they began the program. My next job was King Kullen while in college as a cashier. It was there I was often praised for my punctuality, positivity, haste, and teamwork. Leading to today, where I work at the Mount Sinai Harbor, cleaning peoples boats when they call the office. All of my work experience has given me experience in:
            <ul>
                <li>Teamwork</li>
                <li>Punctuality</li>
